- A project management app for your own community.
- Utilized Firebase noSQL real-time database to manage the user and project data. For
the frontend, I used Bulma.io to make the design simple and clear and used React and
Redux to make it responsive.
- Technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Bulma.io, Firebase
